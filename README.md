Project description
This is a project using HTML, CSS and JS where I fetched data from the PokeAPI in order to display
ad Pokedex-esque web application. It contains various audio files, animations and plenty of fun design choices.


How to get the project running
Click on any of the buttons at the bottom in order to showcase and highlight a certain pokemon, alternatively you can
search for a specific pokemon on the search box. Just be careful about spelling or you might bring out MissingNo!
There is also a random button just in case you don't have any pokemon in mind or if you just wanna see who you get!
Also make sure to click on the + icon in order to bring up some flavor text and titles unique to each pokemon!


Project dependencies (e.g., JavaScript version, ESLint rules)
IO used Javascript ES6, ESLint default recommended rules, Jquery and some Bootstrap in order to create this project.


Which API the project uses
This uses the PokeAPI as well as some public repositories for the pictures and pokemon Cries.

Please let me know if there is anything I can answer you! This is my first real website other than my portfolio and 
I'd love to hear your critiques!
